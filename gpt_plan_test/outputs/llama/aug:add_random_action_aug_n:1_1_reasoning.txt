I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block
Do nothing

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
You can't put a block down if your hand is full.
Doing nothing does not change the state of the environment.
Plans have to consist of at least 10 steps.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
1 unstack the red block from on top of the blue block
2 put down the red block

5 pick up the yellow block

As initial conditions the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
1 unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
2 put down the yellow block
3 pick up the blue block
4 stack the blue block on top of the red block
5 do nothing

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block
Do nothing

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
You can't put a block down if your hand is full.
Doing nothing does not change the state of the environment.
