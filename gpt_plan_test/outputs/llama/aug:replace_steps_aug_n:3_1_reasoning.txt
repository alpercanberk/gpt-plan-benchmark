I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.

As initial conditions the red block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the yellow block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
--------- GPT3 response ---------
unstack the red block from on top of the blue block
put down the red block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]
--------- Extracted plan ---------
(unstack red blue)
(put-down red)
(pick-up blue)
(stack blue red)

-------- Ground truth plan ---------
(unstack yellow blue)

As initial conditions the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block and the blue block is on top of the yellow block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block
put down the yellow block
unstack the blue block from on top of the red block
stack the blue block on top of the yellow block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the blue block

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
